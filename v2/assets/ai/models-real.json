It supports tool use and demonstrates competitive reasoning and coding performance across benchmarks like AIME (99.5% with Python) and SWE-bench, outperforming its predecessor o3-mini and even approaching o3 in some domains. Despite its smaller size, o4-mini exhibits high accuracy in STEM tasks, visual problem solving (e.g., MathVista, MMMU), and code editing. It is especially well-suited for high-throughput scenarios where latency or cost is critical. Thanks to its efficient architecture and refined reinforcement learning training, o4-mini can chain tools, generate structured outputs, and solve multi-step tasks with minimal delay\u2014often in under a minute",
